# Mission Support Foundation for Arma 3

The MSF project is a collection of scripts and resources to make building story driven unique experiences far easier in Arma 3. Instead of copying and pasting a bunch of scripts into the mission folder and using execVM to run them, I took on the task of incorporating all of them into a addon that can be installed through the workshop.

Doing so allowed missions to easily be updated with new content, scripts and bug fixes without having to download, extract, re-publish all your missions.

This project started life as a set of scripts to automate applying custom loadouts to missions automatically, but as the scope expanded and I started adding things outside of loadouts it seemed prudent to re-rganize the project. And as my knowledge of Arma grew, it made things much easier to put this into a mod and add custom attributes to objects to make configureation a breeze.

This mod makes use of ACE 3 (and by extionsion CBA), which is needed for a lot of the custom interactions to work properly.
